**Potential Applications and Values:**

This Dataset mainly discusses about the Titanic survival Passengers.

The Titanic Dataset consists of 12 columns. Those are:

**Passenger ID:** This feature gives us a unique number for every passenger.

**Survived:** This feature helps us in knowing whether the passenger survived or not. 0 means died, 1 means Alive.

By doing the Data Analysis of the dataset, we get to know:

1. what are the major factors that effected the survival of Passengers?

2. what are the steps to be taken care to improve the survival chances?

3. How can we minimize the death rate in future accidents?
